# High-level Threat Intelligence playbooks

In this repository, I wanted to share high-level playbooks that help me stay focused in each aspect of the job as threat intelligence analyst. The playbooks not include details on how to accomplish specific tasks. There are many ways to achieve the tasks for completing each step.

Each playbook can help the Threat Intelligence analyst to organize the tasks and prioritize them by following a set methodology. You can read the article I created about his playbook [here](https://google.com).
